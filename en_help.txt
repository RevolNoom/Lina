	Create a matrix:
	(*)	create <Matrix Name> [<Row> [x] <Column>]
		This will create a matrix with the given name and specified size (if given) or zero matrix (if not)
		Your matrix name must not collide with any of the program's keywords or any of your already existing matrix
		For example:
			create ABC		# Will create matrix ABC with size 0x0
			create ABC 1 9		# Create matrix ABC with 1 row and 9 columns
			create ABC 1x9		# Is the same as the last, using letter 'x' is optional

	Display matrices:
	(*) 	show [Matrix name]
		This command will display the matricx you want to see, or display all matrices you have created if you give it no name
		For example:
			show			# Display ALL matrices
			show ABC		# Display matrix ABC

	Matrix calculation using this application:
		Let's suppose you have 3 matrices: A, B, C of the same size (calculation of different sizes matrices are available,
		but for the sake of this tutorial, I'll keep it simple).
		If you want to assign another value for A, the following syntax will do:
	(*)	A = <Expression>
		Please note that spaces between A, '=' and the expression are Mandatory (for the current release)
		But spaces In The Expression Are Not
		For example: We'll assume that the value of A, B, and C are respectively [1, 2], [3, 4], and [5, 6]
		
			A = B+C 	(This will result in value of A to be [8, 10]. Try "show A" to confirm that)
			A = -B-(C+B)	('A' will be [-11, -14])
		
		Multiplications are also available. Let A, B, C be 2x2 matrices:
			
			A = B*C
			A = A*(B*C)((B+C)(B-C))	

		I hope these examples have given you some slight idea about how to calculate using Lina
	

	Exit the application:
	(*)	exit [Your goodbye speech here] 
	Your goodbye speech will be known to no one. So feel free to say anything!

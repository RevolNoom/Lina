	Create a matrix:
	(*)	create <Matrix Name> [<Row> [x] <Column>]
		This will create a matrix with the given name and specified size (if given) or zero matrix (if not)
		Your matrix name must not collide with any of the program's keywords or any of your already existing matrix
		For example:
			create ABC		# Will create matrix ABC with size 0x0
			create ABC 1 9		# Create matrix ABC with 1 row and 9 columns
			create ABC 1x9		# Is the same as the last, using letter 'x' is optional

	Display matrices:
	(*) 	show [Matrix names]
		This command will display the matrices you want to see, or display all matrices you have created if you give it no name
		For example:
			show			# Display ALL matrices
			show ABC DEF		# Display matrices ABC and DEF

	Exit the application:
	(*)	exit [Your goodbye speech here]
